This plugin enables developers to quickly convert categories and tags into affinitomic elements, enabling the rapid integration of Affinitomics for Wordpress. Affinitomics™ transforms Wordpress into a hyper-relevant, context aware and intelligent powerhouse. If you don’t use Affinitomics (and you should) We encourage you to download Taxonomy Converter by kristarella! Her source made this plugin possible.
